## Land Surface Temperature in Szczecin, West Pomerania (Poland)

### **Overview and main objective**
The project was created to visually identify Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) in Szczecin during summer months. I found the topic interesting because, with increasing challenges due to climate change, living in urban areas can negatively affect the wellbeing of both people and other living beings. I find such projects valuable for public, including decision-makers, as they provide insights that can support actions in the area of spatial planning and urban design. 

### **Learning objectives**

This project serves as a space for practice of geospatial analysis and visualization, with a focus on the following objectives:
- developing spatial and non-spatial data analysis skills
- gaining experience with tools like QGIS, Google Earth Engine and Python libraries commonly used in geospatial science
- experimenting with data analysis and visualization tools
- providing visualizations and insights on topics significant to the health and state of the natural and urban environment

### **Exploring Land Surface Temperature (LST) - description of a process**  

**Defining area of interest**

The Area of Interest is Szczecin's administrative boundary. It was obtained by using Overpass Turbo to query OpenStreetMap data. After downloading, these files were imported into QGIS for initial cleaning. This step included: removing boundaries for a different, smaller town in Poland also named Szczecin and deleting unnecessary map layers, such as deanery boundaries, to focus solely on neighborhoods within Szczecin city.

**Data Acquisition**

The cleaned Szczecin boundary shapefile was uploaded to GEE in order to retrieve Landsat imagery with Land Surface Temperature. I obtained one thermal raster image from August 24, 2024. This date was selected as it falls in the summer, with clear skies over the city, providing an optimal LST measurement without interference from cloud cover out of the available images from the period of time 1.06.2024-31.08.2024.

Moreover, I added the population data for each neighborhood of the city. I wanted to provide more information about population density in neighborhoods for more context. 

**Main outputs**

üåç Mapping mean LST per neighborhood, with a pop-ups showing basic zonal statistics with population density. The map was created with the use of Folium Python library. To do so I perfomed following actions:
- calculating descriptive statistics of LST (min, max, mean) per neighborhood
- calculating the area in square kilometers of each neighborhood and then population density per neighborhood

üåç Mapping LST values for each pixel while hovering over it. The map was created with the use of Bokeh Python library. It was needed to do the following tasks to prepare the map:
- mapping LST values from a raster file onto polygons that represent individual pixels to get geodataframe
- calculating x and y coordinates from polygon geometry for Bokeh chart
